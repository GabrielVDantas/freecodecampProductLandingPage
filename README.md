ðŸ“• Product Landing Page
Welcome to my Product Landing Page!

In this repository, you will find a web page dedicated to promote  chess products, like boards and clocks.

ðŸ“• About the Project
The challenge of creating this Product Landing Page is part of the certification curriculum of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and I'm excited to share it with the community. 
This project wouldn't have been possible without the knowledge and skills I've acquired throughout the course.
